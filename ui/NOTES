BUGS

looks like there is no way to specify the client collation using MySQLdb.  the connect method doesn't accept
collation as a keyword.

setting 'read_default_file' to a file with syntax errors causes flask to crash.
setting 'read_default_file' to a nonexistant file at connect time doesn't do anything.  maybe this error
is handled by reading the default config.

fix:  have to put the collation on the join clause.
