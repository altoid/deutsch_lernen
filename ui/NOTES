BUGS

when adding a word to a word list, the word list will contain the word
multiple times if it exists as more than one part of speech.  e.g. rasen.

fix:  add word_id column to wordlist_word and let it be nullable.  if
a word in a wordlist does not have a word_id, then it is unbekannt.
when we render a list of bekannte Wörter, we'll show the word from the
word table.  for unbekannte wörter we will render the word from
wordlist_word.

issues:
* adding a word - cases
** adding a word to a word list when the word isn't in the word table. 
** adding a word to a word list when the word is in the word table exactly once.
** adding a word to a word list when the word is in the word table more than once.
** adding a new part of speech for an existing word.

looks like there is no way to specify the client collation using
MySQLdb.  the connect method doesn't accept collation as a keyword.
