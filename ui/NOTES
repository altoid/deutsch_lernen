BUGS

when adding a word to a word list, the word list will contain the word
multiple times if it exists as more than one part of speech.  e.g. rasen.

fix:  add word_id column to wordlist_word and let it be nullable.  if
a word in a wordlist does not have a word_id, then it is unbekannt.
when we render a list of bekannte Wörter, we'll show the word from the
word table.  for unbekannte wörter we will render the word from
wordlist_word.

issues:
- deleting a word from a wordlist should not touch the word table.
- have to figure out how to populate the word_id column in
  wordlist_word, esp. for the duplicate words that we are trying to
  avoid.
- cases
-- adding a word to a word list that isn't elsewhere in the
   dictionary.
-- adding a word to a word list that does already exist.
--- if the word exists exactly once, just but its word id into
    wordlist_word.
--- if there are multiple choices, present a form that lets you pick one.

looks like there is no way to specify the client collation using
MySQLdb.  the connect method doesn't accept collation as a keyword.
