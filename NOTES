TODO - really need a better way to deal with reflexive verbs

TODO - import word lists
    CSV:  word, pos, definition

TODO - notes for individual words.  there is already a notes column in the word table.  be aware that
    each word/pos_id pair will have its own notes, as these are a key in the word table.

FIXME - bug:
    go to a wordlist
    select a word - note the return-to-list link
    look up a word, doesn't matter if it's real
    there is no return-to-list link in the resultant lookup page

TODO - programmatically determine whether a verb is irregular.

TODO - Nouns should be three separate parts of speech, one for each gender

TODO - convert quiz apps into a blueprint
    quiz_definitions

TODO - autosave word list notes.

TODO - look for opportunities to use dictionary and set comprehensions.

TODO - create word lists from api calls since wordlists from sql don't give us enough.  examples:
    words in 5 or more lists
    irregular verbs - maintaining this manually isn't enough

FIXME - place names should be properly capitalized.  sometimes they have an article.

TODO - parse definitions, and for each word in the definition that is in the dictionary, make a hyperlink to its
    lookup page.  this may cause hyperlinks to appear in english definitions, but too bad.  to do this, tokenize
    the definition including spaces, look up each token in the dictionary.

TODO - quiz report for a word list, showing word, times presented, # correct, last presentation
    in a table where each column is sortable.  sortable columns require javascript

TODO - show me the words in a word list that were new.  i.e. words added after the word list was created.
    show in italics, bold, etc.

TODO - for parts of speech and their attributes add a display name column distinct from the key.  quiz table
    already does this.

to do local development install:

(venv) MacBookPro:deutsch_lernen dougtomm$ pwd
/Users/dougtomm/src/deutsch_lernen
(venv) MacBookPro:deutsch_lernen dougtomm$ python -m pip install -e .

as of sep 2025 this machine runs the following:

* sequoia 15.6
* python 3.13.7
* mysql 8.4.6

the name of the python executable is python3.  the command 'python'
will not be found in the environment.  do not finesse the PATH
or other env variables to make 'python' appear.  the way to do this
properly is with venv.

'python' and other essential utilities will appear in the virtual
environment.

Dougs-MacBook-Pro:deutsch_lernen dougtomm$ python3 -m venv venv/
Dougs-MacBook-Pro:deutsch_lernen dougtomm$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) Dougs-MacBook-Pro:deutsch_lernen dougtomm$ which python
/Users/dougtomm/src/deutsch_lernen/venv/bin/python

then all you have to do is start the server:

OK

we're using test discovery so that the command to run the suite is as simple as possible.
NOTE!  all the files with unit tests have to match the pattern test*.py, or else unittest won't find them.  stupid.

example of running an individual test:

(venv) MacBookPro:deutsch_lernen dougtomm$ python -m unittest tests.tests_api.APIWordlists.test_real_wordlist

backups

logrotate is configured to rotate the mysql dump file, which is in

~/Dropbox/personal/deutsch_lernen

config file is

/usr/local/etc/logrotate.d/deutsch.conf

backups are run through cron; see crontab -l

------

tests:

1. new word being added is nonempty when stripped - don't add '' or '   ' as words.
2. wordlist citation is never stored as empty string.  it should either be a nonempy string or null.

-----

misc

review how attribute values are stored.  make sure we aren't storing empty strings; unset attribute values
should be null in the database.

----
metadata:
- name
- id
- citation
- sqlcode
- source_is_url (derived value)
- type (empty, standard, smart.  derived value, not stored in database)

contents:
- known words
- unknown words
- notes

operations on list metadata:

- get (given list id)
    all metadata fields
- update (given list id)
    name (required)
    citation
    sqlcode
- create (adding a new empty list)
    name (required)
    citation
    sqlcode
- there is no delete operation on list metadata!  when we delete anything we delete the whole damn list.

operations on list

- get (including contents)
- delete (everything, both metadata and contents)

operations on list contents

- update (adding/deleting words, notes)

----------

word lookup:

by id:  easy

by word:  there will  be 0 or more associated word ids.  for every word id, fetch all attribute values
for the respective part of speech.

we can also get word lists by word id, so for each word we fetch we can get the word lists it's in, if desired.

editing/updating a word:

deleting a word:
we already have an endpoint to delete by id.  that's enough.  we won't ever use it in the UI.

--------------------
string comparisons:

mysql is case insensitive
python is case sensitive
